    <h2>1. Diversity Generates More Revenue</h2>
    <!--paragraph-->
    <p>
        Compared to their peers, high-gender-diversity companies deliver 
        "slightly better returns, and they have outperformed, on average, 
        less diverse companies over the past five years. Companies that not 
        only hire but also manage to retain more women put themselves in a 
        position to automatically gain a competitive advantage, a benefit 
        that extends to all stakeholders. It is hard to deny that women are 
        also responsible for most of the household spending decisions. Not 
        taking advantage of a female presence in the workplace seems like a
         gamble most businesses shouldn't take.

    <h2>2. Women Think Differently</h2>
    <!--paragraph-->
    <p>
        By nature, interacting with a diverse team forces individuals to 
        prepare better and anticipate alternative viewpoints. The presence 
        of women makes individuals anticipate differences in opinion and 
        perspective and makes them assume that they will need to work harder 
        to come to a consensus. We can all benefit from that kind of pressure.
        Men and women see things differently and bring unique ideas to the table. 
        This enables better problem solving, which can boost performance at the 
        business unit level. Imagine all of the buying power you will tap into by 
        bringing together a mix of genders with various backgrounds and ethnicities. 
        Better yet, after your company gains a reputation of having a more diverse workforce, 
        you also gain an extremely powerful recruiting tool at your disposal.

    <h2>3. We Need More Role Models</h2>
    <!--paragraph-->
    <p>
        By celebrating female tech leaders, it will hopefully encourage 
        more girls to pursue their interests and careers in tech, thus 
        increasing the hiring pool diversity. We need to ensure young girls 
        have strong role models of other successful women in STEM and that 
        women have a seat at the table so they can engage men on the topic of gender equality.
        Being a woman in IT is not always easy, and being the only woman in the boardroom 
        at times can put unseen pressure on you. Accountability also inspires action, 
        and we need public policies to ensure employers are doing the right thing. Role 
        models made a huge difference in my life because until I saw people who looked and 
        sounded like me in leadership positions, it was difficult to believe that I could 
        one day make it that far. When you bring women into senior roles, you demonstrate 
        that others have an opportunity to succeed, too.
